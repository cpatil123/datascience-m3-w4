Pre Requisites:
==============
Install reshape2 Library
Using getwd() - undserstand working dir location
Using setwd() - Set working dir to right folder of your choice


The R script, m3w4-proj-code-cvp.R, does the following:
====================================================
Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
Load the activity and feature info
Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
